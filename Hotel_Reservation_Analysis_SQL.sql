/*# Hotel Reservation Analysis with SQL 

* Project Overview:

	This data analysis project aims to gain insights into guest preferences, booking trends, and other key factors that impact the hotel's operations.
        In this project I will use SQL to query and analyze the data, as well as answer specific questions about the dataset.

* Data Source:

	Hotel Reservation Dataset: The primary dataset used for the analysis is the 'Hotel Reservation.csv' file, containing detail information about 
        reservations made by the customers.

* Tools: 

	Database management system: Postgre SQL
	Management Tool: PgAdmin

* Data cleaning:

	In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
	1. Importing data from csv file to management tool PgAdmin
	2. Handling null values.
	3. Data cleaning and formatting.

* Results/Findings:

	The analysis results are summarise as follows:
	1. In 2017 September and October were the months when maximum reservations were made and in 2018 March, April, May, June, August, 
	   and October were the months when the maximum reservations were made by the customers. 
	2. Out of 700 reservations 493 were confirmed and based on this we can say that approximately 70% were confirmed
           reservations and 30% of customers canceled the reservations.
	3. Approximately 73% of the customers booked hotel rooms online.
	4. Room_type_1 was the most popular room type among the customers. 
	5. Meal_plan_1 was the most popular meal among the customers.
	6. Room_type_1 was the most popular room among the customers who had children with them.

* Recommendations: 
	Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:

	1. Invest in marketing (specially online) and increse the online presense with clear room descriptions and images to maximize revenue.
	2. During peak seasons adjust the room rate to maximize revenue.
	3. Develope targeted marketing compaigns for different customer segments, utilise personal offers and loyalty programs.
	4. If possible try to increase or modify the rooms to as same as Room_type_1 as this was the most popular room among the customers and 
	   customers who had children with them.

	
* Questions and SQL queries are as follows: */
